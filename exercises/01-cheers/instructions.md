# Cheers

How do we start a new program?

Let’s try it by building:

A <strong>small</strong> program
that takes <strong>input</strong>
and <strong>does something</strong> with it.

## Cheers, Pt. 1
> requires: strings, puts, ARGV, loops, rdoc

Build on the results of our in-class exploration to output, for example:

    Give me an... A
    Give me a... B
    Give me a... B
    Give me a... Y
    ABBY’s just GRAND!

When given the input of “Abby”.

Note: the “a” vs. “an”


## Cheers, Pt. 2
> requires: time, rdoc

Add on to part 1!  Follow up on the cheer above by asking:

    Hey, Abby, what’s your birthday?

And, replying based on the output with a notification of how many days away their birthday is:

    Awesome!  Your birthday is in 45 days! Happy Birthday in advance!

<u>You’re going to have to use the Ruby Docs.</u>
