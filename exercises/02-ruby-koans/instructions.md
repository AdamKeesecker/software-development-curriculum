# Ruby Koans

It's time to get started on the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).


## Ruby Koans, day 1

Follow the instructions on the Ruby Koans website to get started.

1. Make a few tests pass
2. Think about why those tests passed and what the Koans are trying to teach you.
3. Make note of any lingering questions, so we can discuss them in class.
4. Commit those changes and push them up to Github.

For this milestone, work through the end of `about_symbols`.

## Ruby Koans, day 2

Following the same procedure as day 1, work through to the end of `about_blocks`.

## Ruby Koans, Enlightenment

Finish the Koans.
