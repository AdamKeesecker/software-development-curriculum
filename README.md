software-development-curriculum
===============================

The goal of this repository is to aggregate all of the course materials I've development in the first 3 Nashville Software School cohorts.


## The Plan:

0. Structure this repo in the format of my materials outline/tree.
1. Copy all of the materials accumulated in the last three courses into this repo.
2. User those materials to make a single unified document for each topic.


Note: Step 0 is going to result in a ton of (temporary) duplication, since the materials between cohorts are often very similar.
