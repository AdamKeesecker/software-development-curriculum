software-development-curriculum
===============================

The goal of this repository is to aggregate all of the course materials I've developed in the first three Nashville Software School cohorts.


## The Plan:

0. Structure this repo in the format of my materials outline/tree.
1. Copy all of the materials accumulated in the last three courses into this repo.
2. User those materials to make a single unified document for each topic.


Note: Step 0 has resulted in a ton of (temporary) duplication, since the materials between cohorts are often very similar.

## Contributions:

Contributions are quite welcome!

We have a ton of articles that are documented in the issues list for this repo.


## Notes:

Files with the ".markdown" extension are purposely ignored by the courseware, so that we can use that extension for non-curriculum markdown files.
