Overview of Asset Pipeline
==========================
Introduction to Asset Pipeline

The asset pipeline is one of the biggest new features in Rails 3.1 that was designed to manage your Rails applications’ assets. 
The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets. 
It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages and pre-processors such as CoffeeScript, Sass and ERB.

==========================
Good to know

*At its most basic the asset pipeline is a list of loadpaths. You can see this list by running the console and viewing Rails.application.config.assets.paths.

*The asset pipeline is technically no longer a core feature of Rails 4, it has been extracted out of the framework into the sprockets-rails gem.

*If you do create a new directory however, you’ll need to restart the server before any files you put in there are accessible.

===========================
A Few Notible Features

- Preprocessing

Is handled by the "Tilt" gem. To utilize preprocessing you'll add another extension to a static file's name and specify a processor, for example .erb. 
You can now add ERB code to this file and it will be processed. For example, when a file has an .scss extension this is treated as a preprocessor extension and the file will be passed through the SASS processor. 

(erb stands for "Embedded RuBy". A .html.erb or .erb.html file is HTML with Ruby code embedded in; Rails will evaluate the Ruby to add content to the file dynamically, and will output a "pure" HTML file for rendering.)


- Managing Assets With Sprockets

Sprockets handles dependency management in Rails. Sprockets is a tool for managing libraries of JavaScript (and CoffeeScript) code, declaring dependency management and include 3rd-party code. At its core, Sprockets makes a require method available inside your .js and .coffee files which can pull in the contents of an external file from your project or from a 3rd party gem.
