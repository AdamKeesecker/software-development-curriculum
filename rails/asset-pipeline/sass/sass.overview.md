Sass
============
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Nathan Weizenbaum.

Sass is a preprocessor that lets you use features that don't exist in CSS. Features like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and plenty others that make writing CSS fun again. Sass will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it out as a normal CSS file that you can use in your web site.

Basic Install
============
1. Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.

2. Install Sass. Ruby uses Gems to manage its various packages of code like Sass. In your open terminal window type:

 `$ gem install sass`

 This will install Sass and any dependencies that you need. If you get an error message then it's likely you will need to use the sudo command to install the Sass gem. It would look like:
 
 `$ sudo gem install sass`

3. Double-check. You should now have Sass installed. In your terminal application you can type:

 `$ sass -v`
 
 It should return Sass 3.3.8 (Maptastic Maple). Congratulations! You've successfully installed Sass.
